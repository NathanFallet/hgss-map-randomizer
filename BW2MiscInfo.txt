Changes Made:
-Removed ALL post game locks/unreasonable requirements, including:
*NPCs blocking the way
*Hugh giving dive in Undella Town
*Professor Juniper giving the Permit in her lab
*Professor Juniper activating the Cave of Being event that spawns the Lake Trio
-The randomizer includes maps from both Black 2 AND White 2, though due to limitations, the following will still be version exclusive:
*Black City/White Forest
*Plasma Frigate's basement room
*Route 4
-The only unrandomized maps are ones where you're forced into by an NPC:
*Player's House
*Aspertia Pokemon Center
*Team Plasma's Driftvale House
*PWT Building
*Route 6 Season Research Station
*Lacunosa's Story House
*Plasma Frigate docks in the PWT and Route 21

Flag Information:
-Ghetsis will battle you in Kyurem's room after you talk to Hugh in Crater Forest while it is frozen
-The Hiker blocking the way to Virbank will only move after you talk to Bianca in Aspertia after getting Badge 1, even though he says only the badge is required
-The man in the PWT Gate will only move after you talk to Clay and Hugh in Driftveil after getting Badge 5, even though he says only the badge is required

Some maps have multiple different map files, while others have different states.
Those with map files will have ALL the versions of their map included.
The following is a list of those as to not throw you off too much:
-Crater Forest (Frozen/Damaged)
-Strange House
*For the main rooms, the 3 states are as follows:
  *Phase 1 - Only the leftmost stairs are unblocked
  *Phase 2 - Both stairs and all downstairs rooms are unblocked
  *Phase 3 - The rightmost stairs and all upstairs rooms are unblocked
*ALL these maps will have different warps

The Abyssal Ruins is only randomized at the entrances, so no need to worry about solving the full puzzle.
You can use surf there like any water area, and every entrance can be gotten to
 from every other entrance, even with the step limit (500 steps)

After Opelucid freezes, you will be unable to access some of the warps until you beat the champion
As such, while they can still be used as connectors, nothing important will ever be behind them
