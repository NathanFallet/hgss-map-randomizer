Hey there! I've been sick for the past month and am unable to test the 
thing I made to the extent I want, but I still wanna get it out ASAP

Sooooo I'm releasing a version of the Black 2 and White 2 map rando to the public 
so y'all can continue testing things for me! Not only do I have less work
to do overall, but I can also work on adding more features
and give me more time to work on other cool projects!

Here's some critical information you'll need to know:

The map randomizer is in a working and mostly polished state, 
and in theory every seed should be in order, but I'm almost 
certain that things slipped through the cracks

What I'm looking for is the following:
-Any obvious bugs/crashes/etc
-Impossible seeds because something is locked behind a flag that can't be checked
*Ex: Roxie is locked behind the Pier in Castelia that can only be accessed via the ship that Roxie unlocks
-Warps that haven't been randomized (the logs can confirm if you've been lucky or if it's actually broken)
-Bad warps (2 warps leading to one location, etc)
-If there're any more NPCs I need to send a hitman after because they only move after Iris is beaten
*If you have any QoL suggestions, feel free to let me know!

Some crucial information regarding the technical state of the rom:
-Currently, only English and German versions of the rom can be randomized, 
 and only when the "Black City/White Forest" password is NOT being used
 *If you don't speak English and are translating this via google, 
  if you want your language to be supported then I can very easily do that 
 (it's just some grunt work), just let me know via reporting it like a bug
-Seeds and Seasons are indepenednt of one another- meaning the using the seed 
 "131432759" will give a different result during the spring and winter months
*Seeds will not give the same randomization across Black 2 and White 2
*Spring and Summer are considered the same in the logic, so each seed can 
 produce 3 different maps depending on the season
*The option to randomize the season is also independent of the seed, 
 so basically share both the seed AND the season if you want to play with a friend

-If N dies while following you that's fine, you'll still be able to
 battle him in his throne room and trigger Reshiram spawning in Dragonspiral
